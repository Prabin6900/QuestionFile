-Height should be between 5.2 to 5.6 feet

Write a JAVA program with necessary methods to find whether the person is fit for the police or not. Print “Selected“ when criteria is satisfied and print “Not selected” when criteria are not satisfied. Raise an exception when age is entered negative. Print “Negative age”  when the exception raises.
